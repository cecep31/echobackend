# Memory Leak Fixes - Phase 1 Implementation

## Overview
This document outlines the critical memory leak fixes implemented in Phase 1 to prevent resource leaks and ensure proper application shutdown.

## Issues Fixed

### 1. JWT Middleware Type Assertion Bug
**File:** `internal/middleware/auth_middlerware.go`
**Issue:** Incorrect type assertion in `AuthAdmin()` method that could cause panics
**Fix:** 
- Added proper null checks for user context
- Fixed type assertion from `*jwt.Token` to `jwt.MapClaims`
- Added comprehensive error handling for missing/invalid user context
- Added support for both string and boolean values for `isSuperadmin` claim

### 2. Graceful Shutdown Implementation
**File:** `cmd/main.go`
**Issue:** Application used `e.Logger.Fatal(e.Start(...))` which doesn't handle graceful shutdown
**Fix:**
- Implemented signal handling for SIGTERM/SIGINT
- Added graceful server shutdown with 10-second timeout
- Integrated resource cleanup during shutdown process
- Added proper error handling and logging during shutdown

### 3. Database Connection Cleanup
**Files:** 
- `pkg/database/wrapper.go` (new)
- `pkg/database/setup.go`
**Issue:** Database connections were never properly closed
**Fix:**
- Created `DatabaseWrapper` with embedded `*bun.DB` and cleanup functionality
- Added thread-safe `Close()` method with proper connection cleanup
- Integrated database cleanup into the dependency injection system
- Added connection state tracking to prevent double-close

### 4. Dependency Injection Cleanup System
**Files:**
- `internal/di/cleanup.go` (new)
- `internal/di/container.go`
**Issue:** No centralized resource cleanup mechanism
**Fix:**
- Created `CleanupManager` to orchestrate resource cleanup
- Implemented `Cleaner` interface for resources requiring cleanup
- Added automatic registration of database wrapper for cleanup
- Implemented LIFO (Last In, First Out) cleanup order
- Added timeout support for cleanup operations

## Key Features Implemented

### Graceful Shutdown Flow
1. Application receives SIGTERM/SIGINT signal
2. Echo server stops accepting new connections
3. Existing connections are allowed to complete (10s timeout)
4. Resource cleanup is performed (5s timeout)
5. Application exits cleanly

### Resource Management
- **Database Connections:** Properly closed with connection pool drainage
- **HTTP Server:** Graceful shutdown with connection completion
- **Cleanup Orchestration:** Centralized cleanup with timeout handling

### Error Handling
- Comprehensive error handling during shutdown
- Detailed logging of cleanup operations
- Graceful degradation if cleanup fails

## Testing
- Added unit tests for cleanup functionality
- Verified graceful shutdown behavior
- Tested resource cleanup with mock objects

## Memory Leak Prevention Benefits

1. **Database Connection Leaks:** Eliminated by proper connection cleanup
2. **Goroutine Leaks:** Reduced by graceful shutdown and signal handling
3. **Resource Leaks:** Prevented by centralized cleanup system
4. **Panic-induced Leaks:** Fixed JWT middleware type assertion bug

## Usage

### Running the Application
The application now supports graceful shutdown:
```bash
go run cmd/main.go
# Press Ctrl+C to trigger graceful shutdown
```

### Testing Memory Leak Fixes
```bash
go test ./test/memory_leak_test.go -v
```

## Next Steps (Phase 2 & 3)
- Add request context timeouts across handlers
- Implement connection pool monitoring
- Add memory usage metrics collection
- Create comprehensive memory leak detection tests
- Add runtime metrics and health check endpoints

## Monitoring Recommendations
- Use the existing pprof endpoints (`/v1/debug/pprof/*`) to monitor:
  - Goroutine count: `/v1/debug/pprof/goroutine`
  - Memory allocations: `/v1/debug/pprof/allocs`
  - Heap usage: `/v1/debug/pprof/heap`

## Configuration
The following environment variables control resource management:
- `MAX_OPEN_CONNS`: Maximum database connections (default: 30)
- `MAX_IDLE_CONNS`: Maximum idle database connections (default: 2)
- `CONN_MAX_LIFETIME`: Connection maximum lifetime (default: 30m)
- `DEBUG`: Enable debug endpoints including pprof (default: false)
